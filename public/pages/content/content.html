        Node.js
    </h1>
    <p>
        Node.js is an open source development platform that allows you code and execute javascript serverside. This webpage is an example of a project developed with Node.js
    </p>
    <h1>
        NPM
    </h1>
    <p>
        Npm, also short for Node Package Manager is a massive open source software library. The primary use of npm in this course has been to add/manage packages necessary for software projects like this website. 
        Npm can be used in the terminal with the 'install' keyword to install a package. standing in the root repository of you project, you can install a package by creating a package.json file (specifying packages) and installing it like so:

        package.json example:
        {
            "type": "module",
            "dependencies": {
                "express": "^4.18.1"
            }
        }
        
        To install, write this in the terminal:

        npm install package.json

        npm will look through the package.json file, and install the specified dependencies. Doing so generates a node_modules folder and a package-lock.json
        the node_modules folder contains whatever depencies you have installed while the package-lock.json file describes exactly how all dependencies were installed.   
    
    <h1>
        Express
    </h1>
    <p>
        Express is a light-weight Node.js framework used to develop web applications.
        following our earlier example, Express is installed by defining it as a dependancy and installing it with npm install. Express is what is now contained in the node_modules folder
    </p>
    <h1>
        cross-env
    </h1>
    <p>
        It can be useful to know and control which port the server can be accessed through. For this we can use environment variables.
    </p>

    <h1>
        nodemon
    </h1>
    <p> nodemon is a useful tool when developing a node.js project. Nodemon allows you to run the server, make changes on the fly, and have the server rerun with the changes in realtime
        to run you project with nodemon you simply switch out 'node' with 'nodemon' when running your project. like so:

        "nodemon app.js"
    </p>
    <h1>
        postman
    </h1>
    <p>
        postman is a tool to generate Http requests that is useful when testing out your api. Perhaps you have just finished an endpoint with its full functionality, but you dont have a fully functional frontend ready. In this case you could use Postman to generate whatever HTTP request you desire and see what the api responds.
